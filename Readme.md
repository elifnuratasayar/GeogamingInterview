Overview
This project is a Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) test automation framework built with:
Java
Selenium WebDriver
Cucumber (Gherkin syntax)
JUnit
Maven
It is designed for scalability, maintainability, and clarity when testing modern web applications.

Prerequisites
Before setting up the framework, make sure the following tools are installed on your system:
Java 11 or higher
Apache Maven
Chrome Browser
Chrome Driver(compatible with your Chrome version)
IDE (such as IntelliJ IDEA or VS Code)
Git (for version control)

Project Structure

1.features/ Contains all .feature files written in Gherkin syntax. Each file defines user behavior as test scenarios.
Scenarios can be filtered using @tags.
2.pages/ Page classes follow the Page Object Model (POM).Each page contains locators and reusable actions.
All pages should extend a base class such as BasePage.
3.runners/ Contains test runner classes; CukesRunner/ Runs all or tagged tests.FailRunner./ Re-runs only failed tests
using rerun.txt.
4.steps_definitions/ This folder contains the step definition classes that connect Gherkin steps to Java methods. Each
class usually corresponds to a specific feature file. It also includes hooks/, which use @Before and @After annotations
to handle browser setup and teardown before and after each scenario.
file.
5.utilities/  
Driver/Manages the WebDriver instance using the Singleton design pattern and reads the browser type from
configuration.properties/ BrowserUtils.java: Provides common browser-related utility methods like waiting, title checks,
and URL verifications.
ConfigurationReader/ Reads key-value pairs from the configuration.properties file to support flexible project
configuration.
6.target/ This folder is automatically generated by Maven after test execution. It contains compiled classes and test
output,
including Cucumber reports. After running your tests, you can find the generated HTML or JSON reports here under
paths like cucumber-reports.html
